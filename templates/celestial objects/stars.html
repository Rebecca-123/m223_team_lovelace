    Stars defined our study of the night sky. Our ancestors looked to the sky but they couldn't make out faint galaxies, theorize about black holes, or conduct
    astrophotometrical experiments to verify the potential existence of exoplanets, but they could see stars in the night as sure as they could see the sun during the day.
    The sun itself is a star, though it is much closer and thus its apparent magnitude (the measure of how bright something is to us) is far greater. Well, actually
    it would be lower as lower magnitudes are brighter, but you get the idea.

    Stars vary in size and temperature. There are some stars so small they blur the line between planet and star. These are known as brown dwarfs and are not massive
    enough to begin fusing hydrogen into helium through the proton-proton chain reaction. Instead what little leftover heat they have will drive deuterium fusion,
    and will gradually slow down and cool down over time. Red dwarfs are the smallest, though the rate at which fusion occurs is also much slower, thus red dwarfs
    have lifetimes millions of times longer than the most massive stars, which burn through their fuel and end their lifecycles in a matter of millions of years.
    Stars can be sorted by their luminosity (brightness, which increases with size) and temperature using a Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram, of which
    a simplified version is depicted below. </p>

        Stars move through the various groups in the diagram throughout their lifetime. Stars form in regions of space densely packed with gas clouds sometimes
        called "stellar nurseries." After accumulating enough mass, density, and sufficient temperature, they begin fusing hydrogen into helium
        as main sequence stars, then stay there in the H-R Diagram, only moving slightly up the diagonal through their lifespan. The main sequence  Nearing the end of their life,
        stars will begin to fuse helium alongside hydrogen, in a shell that surrounds a core of carbon and oxygen.
        This increase in the stellar output causes the star to expand dramatically, sometimes ending up more than two astronomical units across. The layer of helium
        fuel begins to run low, and sporadic bursts of helium fusion lead to the expulsion of the star's outer layers, leaving the mostly carbon and oxygen core exposed as a white dwarf.
        More massive stars continute fusing heavier elements through the triple-a process, resulting in onion-like layers of hydrogen, helium, carbon, neon, oxygen, silicon, and an iron core.
        However, because fusing iron is an endothermic process, the star loses the necessary pressure to withstand gravity and collapses, resulting in a supernova.
        The remnant is a neutron star, only prevented from further collapse by neutron degeneracy forces. Even more massive stars collapse into black holes.

    Below is a visualization of how much the sizes of stars can vary. The sun is on the left and the image on the right represents the selected star.
    Colors are not accurate, only the size. Have fun scrolling through the last few!
